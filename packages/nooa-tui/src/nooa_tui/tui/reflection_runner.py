"""Idle-reflection runner: consolidate memory while the user isn't looking.

Owns the lifecycle state machine from
``docs/design/memory-system/design-idle-reflection.md`` §3::

    IDLE --(response done)--> DEBOUNCE --> RUNNING --> IDLE
                                  |            |
                                  +--(input)---+--> interrupted --> IDLE

The runner lives on the agent thread's event loop: ``on_response_done()`` is
called by the dispatcher when a turn ends and the prompt returns to the user;
``interrupt()`` is awaited wherever new input is about to reach the agent.
The consolidation itself runs in an executor thread via
``MemoryManager.reflect_interruptible``, whose per-item commits make an
interrupted (or briefly overlapping) pass safe by construction.
