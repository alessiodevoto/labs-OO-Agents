"""On-demand "where is the agent stopped?" probe for the TUI.

Answers the question the ``/activity`` command poses — not just *what phase*
the agent is in (python / llm / idle), but *where in the code* it is currently
suspended.

Why this lives here and not in the core framework:

- The agent runs as a coroutine on a dedicated asyncio loop on its own thread
  (``TUIApplication._ensure_agent_loop``). A point-in-time "where is it"
  snapshot is answered by asyncio task introspection (``Task.get_stack()``),
  which must run *on the agent loop* — ``asyncio.Task`` is not safe to walk
  from another thread. The ``ActivityCommand`` already has ``agent_run()``,
  which executes a callable on the agent loop, so the probe runs there and
  returns plain data back across the thread boundary.
- ``sys.monitoring`` is the wrong tool for an on-demand probe: its callbacks
  fire on the *executing* thread (not the asker's), there is no per-thread
  instrumentation, and always-on ``LINE`` events cost ~3x runtime. It is built
  for continuous collection (debuggers, coverage), not snapshots.

No core (``src/``) changes are required.
