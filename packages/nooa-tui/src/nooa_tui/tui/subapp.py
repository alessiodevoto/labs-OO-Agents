"""Reusable in-app subview primitives for the terminal TUI.

A subview is not a nested prompt_toolkit Application. It is a lightweight
state/render/key object hosted by the single long-lived TUIApplication so
terminal ownership, resize handling, mouse input, and focus remain centralized.

Subview conventions:

- ``q`` closes the subview.
- ``Esc`` is contextual inside the subview (clear/cancel/back), not the generic
  close key.
- The host owns resize handling; subviews render to the supplied width/height and
  must not launch their own prompt_toolkit Application or terminal-size poller.
