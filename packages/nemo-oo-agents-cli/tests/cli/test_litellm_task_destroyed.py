"""Regression tests: litellm LoggingWorker task-destroyed warnings suppressed.

The litellm GLOBAL_LOGGING_WORKER singleton creates infinite-loop tasks on
whatever event loop is current. When the agent loop is torn down, those
tasks would emit "Task was destroyed but it is pending!" — which pollutes
the TUI scrollback. These tests verify our suppression layers work.
